## Bandcamp Collection Extras

Bandcamp fan pages are nice. They list purchases and wishlists of your own and
other "fans", and allow you to play them. But to see pricing, you need to click
through. That's tedious, especially since the page has this information!
It just doesn't display it.

This userscript `bandcamp-collection-extras` takes that pricing information
and displays it for all Bandcamp fan pages. Check it out:

### Installing

1. Install the [Tampermonkey extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for your browser.
2. Open the [bandcamp-collection-extras.user.js](bandcamp-collection-extras.user.js) link.
3. Find the "raw" button on that page near the top right and click it.
4. This should launch Tampermoney and it will ask if you would like to install the userscript (you do).
5. Visit [a Bandcamp collection](https://bandcamp.com/drench) page and see the extension in action!
